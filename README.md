# Titanic_kaggle_prediction

A Machine Learning Classification Project

This project builds and tests different binary classification models to predict whether a passenger survived the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic.

Using the data provided by the most famous competition hosted by Kaggel, I have performed the following actions:
 * Exploratory Data Analysis
 * Feature Engineering
 * Model defination
 * Prediction
 * Performation Metrics Comparision

*Age
*Sex
*Passenger Class
*Ticket
*Cabin
*Fare
*Family relationships (SibSp, Parch)
*Embarkation port
